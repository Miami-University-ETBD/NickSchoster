                <h2>The Development Process</h2>
                <p><strong>Bug Bouncers</strong> was created as part of the <u>2025 Global Game Jam</u>. Given a time limit of <em>three days</em>, I developed this game from start to finish.</p>
                <p>Using <strong>Unity2D 2023</strong>, I built almost eveything myself. There were many fetures that I did not get to add due to the time limit, but they may make an apperience in the future.</p>

                <h2>Art & Code</h2>
                <p>Every visual element in <strong>Bug Bouncers</strong> was created by me. This includes the background artwork as well as the players and enemies. I designed them in a pixel art style.</p>
                <p>On the coding side, I wrote all the scripts myself, which was hard considering the time limit. </p>

            <p>Participating in the game jam was an intense but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about rapid game development and balancing mechanics under the preasure of a tight deadline.</p>
