                <h2>About the Game</h2>
                <p><strong>Bug Bouncers</strong> is a fast-paced platforming and momentum based game where players control an insect that is trapped <u>inside a bubble</u>. Players must use strategic movement to outmaneuver their opponents and knock them into the grass to pop their bubbles.</p>
                <p>The player's survival depends on skillful bouncing! If your bubble touches the grass first, you lose, and the game restarts. The mechanics are fairly simple to get down quickly. You must be the last bug standing</p>
